<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/fof/" target="_blank">Financial Accounts of the United States</a>, known as Z1, contains data that track the movement of money among different sectors of the economy such as households and nonprofit organizations, nonfinancial corporate businesses, and nonfinancial noncorporate businesses. It includes data on transactions and levels of financial assets, liabilities and balance sheets.</p>
</section>
<section id="data" class="slide level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Data is publicly available, but due to the number of data sets and scattered tables and definitions, it is hard to understand, obtain, and analyze data.</p>
